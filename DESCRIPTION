Title: Wicked-Fast Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') Reader
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2016-08-27

Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rud.is>
Description: Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') has one 'JSON' record per-line and many modern
    'ndjson' files contain large numbers of records. These constructs may not be
    columnar in nature, but it's often useful to read in these files and "flatten"
    the structure out to work in an R data.frame-like context. Functions are provided that
    make it possible to read in plain 'ndjson' files or compressed ('gz') 'ndjson'
    files and either validate the format of the records or create "flat" data.table
    ('tbl_dt') structures from them.
