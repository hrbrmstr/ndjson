Description: Streaming 'JSON' ('ndjson') has one 'JSON' record per-line and
    many modern 'ndjson' files contain large numbers of records. These constructs
    may not be columnar in nature, but it is often useful to read in these files
    and "flatten" the structure out to enable working with the data in an R
    'data.frame'-like context. Functions are provided that make it possible to read
    in plain 'ndjson' files or compressed ('gz') 'ndjson' files and either validate
    the format of the records or create "flat" 'data.table' structures from them.
