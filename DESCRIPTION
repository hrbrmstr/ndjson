Title: Wicked-fast Streaming JSON ('ndjson') Reader
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2016-08-25
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr)
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rudis.net>
Description: Streaming JSON ('ndjson') has one JSON record per-line and many modern
    'ndjson' files contain large numbers of records. These constructs may not be
    columnar in nature, but it's often useful to read in these files and "flatten"
    the structure out to work in an R data.frame context. Functions are provided that
    make it possible to read in 'ndjson' from character vectors or files and create
    "flat" data.table structures from them.
